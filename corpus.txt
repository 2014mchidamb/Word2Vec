the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
I love cats and dogs
sung like cats
she loves dogs
When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul
I won't give up
On
Us
